Hello __,

The analytics team is trying to understand how trends in brand purchases (captured in our receipts) 
relate to user behavior. We seek to understand how brands rank in terms of spend and purchase volume 
among certain cohorts of users. However, there are some issues with the cleanliness of the data logged 
from our production database which will need resolution before we can draw any insights. 

In order to resolve these issues, we need various stakeholders (from engineering and product) to help 
answer the questions below. Can you please help put me in contact with the right stakeholders so we can 
go over these questions?


Questions for product managers:

- What is the `CPG` for a brand? How does the app consume or produce a CPG entity? 
  Can it be used to categorize brands?

- How is line item metadata is inferred from scanned receipts? 
  What is the process by which this happens and which data sources / 3rd parties are involved, if any?

- Is your brands database the result of both identified brands from receipts and existing partnerships? 
  Are there any other ways brands are acquired into the database?


Questions for engineers:

- How are brand entities loaded into the brands collection?

- Do receipt line item entities have a data model? 
  Where is this documented and how is it enforced before being sent to the receipts collection?

- Why do receipt line items not have a reference to a unique brand id?

- Why are there so many missing brand codes from the receipt line items?
